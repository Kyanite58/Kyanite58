ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kyanite58 (obviously not my real name)

I'm a college student and currently learning programming langauges, preparing for GATE exam, completing different courses.

I feel like upcoming years are going to be my exponential learning curve, that is, if I keep up the consistency.

I really like space, robotics stuff, I also play different games follow anime/manga (few and since they are monthly I kinda use them as new month new chapter kinda thing).

Even right now I dont really understand how to use github properly but I will hopefully before this month ends.

Thats all for now, I wish to edit this after knowing more a bout github.
